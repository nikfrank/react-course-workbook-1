# react course workbook 1

This is the first example where we'll write some JSX in the react course

Our goal is to cover JSX basics (using HTML + CSS ish, breakouts) and some routine CSS for lists.

Also we'll see the usual pattern for rendering data out of the state

see [lesson page](https://github.com/nikfrank/react-course/blob/master/lessons/1.md)
and [course page](https://github.com/nikfrank/react-course) for full details


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
